## Princples of Data Science - Lectures

This folder will contain .pdf versions of the lecture notes and also the python notebooks used to deliver the lectures.

The actual lecture slides are all delivered from `jupyter notebooks` (aside from the times we make use of handwritten proofs etc.).
If you have installed the appropriate `conda` environment for the module then you should be able to run these notebooks locally in your browser (and you can of course then modify them and change them).
The notebooks will also display in your browser directly on the `gitlab` page but just in "read-only" mode, i.e. you won't be able to run them or modify them.

To actually display the notebook as a slideshow, I make use of the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension for jupyter.
Note, that at the time of writing (September 2023) the RISE extension is not compatible with jupyter 7 so you need jupyter 6 installed.
