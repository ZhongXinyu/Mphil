what is difference between f and y 
y is a noised up version of f : y = f + noise

does f centered at 0 means that y is also centered at 0?
This is only the prior, not the posterior

In the paper, what is the difference between u and u_hat, what is the difference between N and M
u_hat is choosen from z_m, u is choosen from z_n, M is a subset of N???


What is the prior, likelihood and posterior in GP

Optimization failed, try increasing max_iters or using a different optimiser.(What is the optimiser and why there is iteration)

equation 6,7,8

There is no chance that in real life we can apply the complete GP, because we don't know the true function.
If we know, there would not be necessary to do the GP.

Is kernel a function of data or entire dataspace
Kernel is a function of data, it has the dimension of (N,N) where N is the number of data points

What is the time complexity of GP?
O(N^3) or O(N^2) depending on the implementation? The time-consuming step is the inversion of the kernel matrix??
No it is always O(N^3) because the inversion of the matrix is O(N^3) and decomposition is O(N^3)            

How to implement the differential equation in to Kernel in GP Jax

KL divergence and ELBO

Is the addition of the derivative terms equivalent as add other terms and a regularisation term in the kernel?
